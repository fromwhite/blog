Space - under development and testing.

There are many ideas to explore, Communicate through text and voice like Twitter space,private and non-public.
It doesn't necessarily have to be a person, but a very familiar friend who understands these ideas, knows what has been written and done, and even has its own ideas. Unlike adding a BOT directly, AI BOT are influenced by public data, and I hope it play the role of a friend. Compared to public data, its closer to private data.

This guy has a great idea, using openai to summarize his posts [semantic search](https://blog.maximeheckel.com/posts/building-magical-ai-powered-semantic-search/). It's like having a personal assistant to reduce memory worries. Using notes data to retrain the generated model, I tried several plans but failed. It may be that I missed something. There are also some interesting things, [candle llama](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmz/candle-llama2).
