Before using MDX contentlayer, there were many blogs, such as jekyll hexo, and so on. They have a feature that I really like, which is using tag indexing.
Another blog [forked from waynezhang/blog Tag](https://lhzhang.com/tags.html).

Static pages can be deployed on Github and use vercel serverless as the backend.
Full-text search is best done offline. In addition to indexing like jekyll, it can also be used for word segmentation and text similarity search.

There is a game, Disco Elysium, that has a model called stream of consciousness, which allows players to play the game without having to remember things. When the player thinks of a part, it will find the complete part.

This is pretty close to my idea, I donâ€™t need to remember the specific content. When I remember a fragment of it, the model will figure out the associated complete part on its own.

Unfortunately, I can't find a way to implement this idea. I copied the full-text search of this guy's [DawChihLiou](https://github.com/DawChihLiou). Vector similarity search written in Rust.
In 2019, I developed a topology editor using WebAssembly and was very impressed by it.
His search can temporarily replace Tag. I hope to find a way to achieve it, to be continued.
