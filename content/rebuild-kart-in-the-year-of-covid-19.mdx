## The beginning

During the New Year holiday,
Hubei was placed under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Unable to leave my county,
and stay away from the hustle and bustle of the major city's 996 culture,
I made a decision to finally pursue a long-abandoned plan.

## Shelved

A few years ago,
I made a Kart, made the body by welding iron pipes, assembled toy car parts,
and used batteries to drive the motor.
It ultimately failed because the motor power, its low-power motor can't take anything.
Because the accessories are found in scrap, their reliability is very poor.

## Scheduled to last

I want to complete it well this time.
I have enough time and have prepared excellent things.
This is a goal that has been forgotten for a long time and often wanted to be achieved.
Now let me do it. It's very exciting.

I've been preparing some cool things for a long time.
I bought professional Kart accessories on Taobao last year,
this is to solve the reliability problem of the metal structure of the kart.
If iron pipes are used to weld the frame, it will easily withstand the weight of an adult,
then the remaining aspects are motor power and battery selection.

The most important battery is the Tesla used disassembled lithium battery pack customized on Taobao.
The motor controller uses an high-power controller with RC modell,
Up to 80A per unit.
This time, there are two sets of high-power aircraft model motors, T-Motor P80 gen2.

Maybe I should write in more detail, such as karting and RC models.

## Finally, I stole this guy's kart car
