## The beginning

After returning home this new year holiday, I was lockdown in Hubei because of COVID19.Stopped to do somethings during this time, fishing and outdoors with friends. Then I have a plan, long standing but unfinished.

## Shelved

A few years ago, I made a Kart, made the body by welding iron pipes, assembled toy car parts, and used batteries to drive the motor.
It ultimately failed because the motor power, its low-power motor can't take anything.
Because the accessories are found in scrap, their reliability is very poor.

## Scheduled to last

I want to complete it well this time. I have enough time and have prepared excellent things.
Forgetting it's 996,
Stay away from the troubles of working in southern cities.
Now let's do it. It's exciting.

I bought professional Kart accessories on Taobao last year, but I didn't have time at that time.
Welding the frame with molten iron pipes.
The most important battery is the Tesla used disassembled lithium battery pack customized on Taobao.
The motor controller uses an aviation model high-power controller, Up to 80A.
This time, there are two sets of high-power aircraft model motors, T-Motor P80 gen2.

Maybe I should write in more detail, such as karting and airplane models.
