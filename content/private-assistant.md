Space - under development and testing.

For a handy note, there are a lot of ideas to explore here, communicating via text and voice, like Twitter spaces, which are private and non-public.
It is not like a person, but more like a very familiar friend who understands these ideas, knows what has been written and done, and even has its own understanding. Unlike adding BOT directly, AI BOT will be affected by public data, and I hope it will play the role of a friend. It is closer to private data than public data.

This guy had a great idea, he used openai to summarize his post [Semantic Search](https://blog.maximeheckel.com/posts/building-magical-ai-powered-semantic-search/). It's like having a personal assistant to reduce memory worries. Inspired by this, I tried several times to retrain the already generated model by using note data, but all failed. Maybe I missed something. And some fun stuff, [candle llama](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmz/candle-llama2). waiting for update.
