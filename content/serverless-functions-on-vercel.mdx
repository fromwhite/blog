# Serverless Functions on Vercel

This is a test of MDX, which its still a lot of incomplete parts and may be completed

Note: Estimate Pi with Monte Carlo Method

```rust
let mut rng = oorandom::Rand32::new(seed);
const RADIUS: u64 = 424242;
const LOOPS: u64 = 1_000_000;

let mut counter = 0;
for _ in 0..LOOPS {
  let x: u64 = rng.rand_range(1..RADIUS as u32).into();
  let y: u64 = rng.rand_range(1..RADIUS as u32).into();

  if (x.pow(2) + y.pow(2)) < (RADIUS.pow(2)) {
    counter += 1;
  }
}

let pi = (4.0 * counter as f64) / LOOPS as f64;
```
